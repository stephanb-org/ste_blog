*Hello, Friend. That's lame. Maybe I should give you a name.* Well, that's a quote from Mr Robot TV Series intro - and I find it the most appropriate way to start this conversation. 

This blog has been on my ToDo list for more than a year pending. Initially, I had decided to build my website using WordPress. I felt that it was an obvious choice as we utilise WordPress to build a great functional website for our clients. As I was restricted with time, I had decided to select a WordPress theme off-the-shelf. However, I kept reaching a dead-end. As it was not part of my workflow, I kept postponing the due date.

Earlier this year, I decided to switch from WordPress to Jekyll. The idea of using markdown and a simple text-editor appealed to me. Furthermore, setting up the website took me less than it used to take me to configure the database for WordPress and initialising the WampServer.

## Road Map

"So, what is the point of having a website?" you might ask. Well, for starters it's 2020 and I have been meaning to publish a portfolio of works for some time. This may serve to just do that.

Nonetheless, I have decided to place my writings on the epicentre of this webpage. Topics will range from 3D printing and laser cutting to architectural commentary and critique. I dabble in a bit of everything. I program software, write articles, sculpt things, paint things, carve things, learn things, design, assemble and build things. This is where I intend to put all the stuff I want to share in a more permanent format.

## Conclusion

Blogging might even get fun again and this of course was just a test article I needed to check it out.
