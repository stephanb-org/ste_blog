<p>Ellipsoidal pods try to break the rules from lifeless obstructing structures and concrete planes at Wied iz-Zurrieq. Soft rounded concrete surfaces eliminate the deflection of
sunlight due to the absence of corners within the structure.</p>

<p>A large public amphitheatre invites groups of people to socialize and enjoy meals overlooking the shore, with a cantilevered decking that include permanent nets for sun bathing. The individual pods allow for a more private setting that may be used by a couple or a small group.</p>

<p>The interior of the pod reciprocates the feeling of being outside by mimicking rock formations found on shore with the use of sinusoidal cross-sectional foam flooring. Front
UV-filtered windows are opened by a crank rotating in the direction of the sun path allowing the user to control both the shade and sunshine intensity. The volumes complement the elements of rocky shores, sea and sun with a light and bright tone materials that give an appetite to visitors for salty meals and cold lemonades.</p>
