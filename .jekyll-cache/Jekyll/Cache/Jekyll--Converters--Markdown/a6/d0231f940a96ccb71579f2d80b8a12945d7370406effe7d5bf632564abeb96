I"œ<p>A curated display of scanned etchings, produced mid-2016. The scope of the following drawings was to express movement using a spectrum of art that requires a labour intensive methodology. Light lineweights were produced by etching these lines at a stage where the acid had already started its reaction on the copper plate.</p>

<p>Scraps, or otherwise etchings that have not been selected for showcase, have been included down below.</p>
